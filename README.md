#  Standardising heterogeneous tags
---

The algorithm is instance of programming by example that uses syntactic clustering to infer and annotate sensor tags from BMS (Building Management Systems) semi-automatically. This algorithm can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](/Jupyter\ Notebook/) folder

The goal is to produce an algorithm/methodology that standardises a list of sensor names (regardless of the BMS it comes from, and its original format) to a single naming convention, and additionally enrich the data set with meta-data by extracting/inferring features. This should be done with minimal work to the user.
